Step 1: Check the Wazuh Repository Entry
Open the sources list to see the configuration for Wazuh. Run the following command to open the file in a text editor:

sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/wazuh.list

Look for the repository entry. It should look something like:

deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/wazuh-keyring.gpg] https://packages.wazuh.com/4.x/apt stable main

Verify the signed-by path. The error suggests there might be two conflicting paths, likely /usr/share/keyrings/wazuh-keyring.gpg and /usr/share/keyrings/wazuh-keyrings.gpg. Confirm the exact path being used.

If you notice a conflicting path, update the signed-by field to the correct one (/usr/share/keyrings/wazuh-keyring.gpg) and save the file.

Step 2: Re-import the Keyring
To ensure the correct keyring is being used, re-import the Wazuh GPG key.

Run the following command:

sudo wget -O /usr/share/keyrings/wazuh-keyring.gpg https://packages.wazuh.com/key/GPG-KEY-WAZUH

This will download the official Wazuh GPG key and save it to the correct location.

Step 3: Update the Package List
Once the sources file and keyring are properly configured, update the package list.

Run:

sudo apt update
If there are no errors, proceed with the system upgrade:

bash
CopyEdit
sudo apt upgrade -y
