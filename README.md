# Security Monitoring with Graylog SIEM for Catnip Games International 🎮🔍

## 🛡️ Project Overview**
This project implements a centralized security monitoring solution** using **Graylog SIEM**, **Elasticsearch**, and **Python automation** for **Catnip Games International**. It ensures real-time threat detection, log analysis, and automated alerting** across their **gaming infrastructure**, which includes **300+ Linux game servers, authentication systems, and development environments. The solution detects and mitigates threats such as:

✅ Unauthorized access attempts on player authentication systems  
✅ DDoS attacks targeting game servers 
✅ Suspicious activity in development environments  

This project follows industry best practices for Security Operations Center (SOC) workflows, ensuring high availability, automated alerting, and compliance reporting while handling 10,000+ events per second efficiently.

## 🛠️ Key Features & Capabilities

### 1️⃣ Centralized Security Monitoring with Graylog
🔹 Log Aggregation: Collecting logs from game servers, authentication systems, network devices, and development environments  
🔹 Real-time Dashboards: Creating custom security dashboards to monitor threats and system health  
🔹 Log Parsing & Normalization: Ensuring structured, meaningful logs for analysis  

### 2️⃣ Automated Threat Detection & Alerting
🚨 Correlation Rules & Security Alerts** for detecting:
✔️ Brute-force login attempts**  
✔️ Unusual access patterns** from suspicious locations  
✔️ DDoS attack indicators  

🔔 Automated Alerts: Email & Slack notifications for immediate incident response  

### 3️⃣ Performance-Optimized SIEM Infrastructure
⚡ Handles 10,000+ events per second (EPS) with sub-5 second query responses  
🔄 High Availability Setup with failover support ensuring 99.9% uptime  
🛠️ Efficient Storage & Retention Strategies (hot/cold storage management)  

4️⃣ Automated Security Reports**
📅 Weekly security reports** generated automatically with Python  
📊 Compliance reports for regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, security audits)
